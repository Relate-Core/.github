# Contributing to Relate

Relate values clarity over cleverness and simplicity over complexity.

Contributions are welcome only if they align with the purpose of the project. This is not a feature request board and not a place for speculative ideas.

Before contributing, ensure that your change:
- Preserves simplicity
- Improves clarity
- Does not add unnecessary abstraction
- Aligns with the intent of the tool or system

Pull requests that add complexity without clear benefit will be declined.

Discussion is encouraged. Noise is not.

By contributing, you agree that your work may be modified or rejected to maintain coherence.

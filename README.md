# Relate Core

Relate builds tools, puzzles, and systems that explore how people think, decide, and act.

The focus is not productivity or motivation. It is execution, momentum, and the hidden patterns that cause capable people to stall despite effort.

This organization hosts public tools, logic based experiments, puzzles, and reference implementations that make these patterns visible. The goal is clarity. When clarity exists, action follows.

Relate is designed for builders, operators, and thinkers who care about understanding behavior at a fundamental level rather than optimizing surface habits.

This is not a community project.
This is not a content repository.
